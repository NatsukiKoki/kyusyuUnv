\subsubsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

I only change the learning rate and remove the DBSCAN from SyncMap using
a self made function instead to determine the cluster in this task.
These two modifies make the SynMap run better on Overlap2 comparing to
the original SyncMap, however it performs equally to the orginial on
Overlap1, both my modified version of the SynMap and the orginial
version can not have a very good performance on Overlap1, the accuracy
cannot exceed \(75%
\), and my modified version is not stable. So I don't think I complete
this task. Due to the lack of knowledge, I cannot find a better
solutation towards this question. \#\#\# My modification In this part, I
will only introduce the change of learning rate, the replacement of
DBSCAN will be introduced in the next task. Although, the author
mentioned in the paper that ``These parameters were the best performing
without unnecessary slowdown after a dozen trials'', I still think that
maybe a learning rate which decrease with the number of epoch trained,
will get a better performance. So I first double the initial learning
rate, because I will decrease the learning rate during the learning, it
may cause the SyncMap to take more step to reach the best solution if I
don't increase the initial learning rate. In the first half of the
learning loops I keep the learning rate the same as the initial, and the
other half of the learning loops I lineally decrease the learning rate
from initial to \(1/2\) initial because when it closer to the result I
want the learning rate to be smaller in order to get a more accuracy
result. \#\# {[}A3{]}\{X\} Remove DBSCAN from SyncMap. Use edges and
weights to determine clusters. Your results is to both decrease the
variance from SyncMap and increase accuracy in most of the tasks. \#\#\#
Introduction In this task I replace the DBSCAN with a method based on
the edges and weights to determin clusters. The method is inspired by
both the DBSCAN and the Spectral Clustering. \#\#\#\# DBSCAN The DBSCAN
algorithm, which stands for ``Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise,'' is a clustering algorithm designed to
identify groups of data points in a set based on their density.
Developed in 1996 by Martin Ester, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Jörg Sander, and
Xiaowei Xu, it is particularly effective for datasets with arbitrary
shapes and densities.

The algorithm requires two parameters:\textgreater{}

Epsilon (eps): This parameter defines the maximum distance between two
samples for them to be considered in the same neighborhood. MinPts: The
number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered a core
p

int. It is one of the two key factors that dictate the behavior of the
algorithm. In general, larger values of MinPts result in fewer noise
points but can lead to data points from different clusters being
assigned to the same cluster, while smaller values of MinPts can result
in more noise points but might separate clusters bet ter. The DBSCAN
algodefines three kinds of pointsol\textgreater ows:

Core Points: For each data point, a sphere of radius eps is defined
around it. If there are more than or equal to MinPts points within this
sphere (including the point itself), the data point is considered a
``core \textgreater{} \textgreater Border Points: For each data point, a
sphere of radius eps is defined around it. If there are less than MinPts
points within this sphere (including the point itself) and has at least
one Core point in this sphere, the data point is considered a''border
point.'' \textgreater{} \textgreater Noise Points: points are neither
border point nor core point

The four relationships defined by DBSCAN: \textgreater point.'' Directly
Reachable: Any point within the eps distance of a core point is
considered ``directly reachable'' from that cor\textgreater{}
\textgreater e point. Density-Reachable: If there is a chain of points,
each within eps distance of the next one, and all of the points are core
points, then every point on the chain is ``density-reachable'' from
every ot \textgreater{} \textgreater Connected: If there is a point n
that density-reachable both point x and y, then we call the points x and
y are ``Connected''. \textgreater{} \textgreater Unconnected: If there
is not any point n that density-reachable both point x and y, then we
call the points x and y are ``Disonnected''.

The DBSCAN algorithm steps are divided into two phases.
\textgreater Phase 1: Finding Core Points to Form Temporary Cluster :
Scan all sample points. If the number of points within the radius R of a
certain sample point is \textgreater= MinPoints, include it in the list
of core points, and form a corresponding temporary cluster with the
points density-reachable from it\textgreater Phase 2: .

Merging Temporary Clusters to Form Clus ers: For each temporary cluster,
check if its points are core points. If they are, merge the temporary
cluster corresponding to that point with the current temporary cluster
to obtain a new temporary clus\textgreater ter.

Repeat this process until each point in the current temporary cluster is
either not in the core points list or all its density-reachable points
are already in that temporary cluster, upgrading the temporary cluster
to a cl\textgreater uster.

Continue merging the remaining temporary clusters in the same way until
all temporary clusters are \#\#\#\# Spectral Clustering

Spectral Clustering (SC, is a graph-based clustering method that can
identify arbitrarily shaped sample spaces and converge to the global
optimum. Its basic idea is to use the eigenvectors obtained by
decomposing the similarity matrix of the sample data for clustering. It
is independent of sample features and only depends on the number of
samples.

The basic idea is to regard the samples as vertices and the similarity
between samples as weighted edges, thus transforming the clustering
problem into a graph partitioning problem: finding a graph partitioning
method that minimizes the weight of edges connecting different groups
(meaning that inter-group similarity is as low as possible), while
maximizing the weight of edges within a group (meaning that intra-group
similarity is as high as possible \#\#\# My method Inspired by the
DBSCAN and the Spectral Clustering, I developed a alogrism which doesn't
need to determine the number of clusters manully like DBSCAN and works
like the Spectral Clustering. My method can be divided into 4 steps:
\textgreater Step 1. Calculate the distance between each given points: I
use the torch.norm(a{[}:, None{]}-a, dim=2, p=2) function to calculate
the distance between each points. This function also translate the point
list into a distance map. In my function I use the Euclideac distanc,
which can be replace by other kind of distance function which is not
linear.e \textgreater Step 2. Calculate the shortest distance of each
pair of points: I used a Floyd Warshall algorithm to calculate this.
This step is similar to the phase 2 in DBSCAN, which enrise the size of
the original cluster This step is designed to deal with the situation
which doesn't use Euclidean distance.. \textgreater Step 3: Discard the
distance which is longer than max bearable distance: I simply set those
pairs of points unreachable. In this way we seperate the clusters apart.
The points in the sam cluster have less distance to each other than the
points belongs to other cluster. \textgreater Step 4: Find all the
cConnected component in the graph:I use the DFS to do this job. this job
will generate the label for each point. \#\#\# Conclusion My method is
simple than the original DBSCAN and can perform better on overlaping
test, but it has a less accuracy when dealing with the high dimention
test. May be using other distance function other than Euclidean distance
will improve the performance. \#\#\# Code and result
