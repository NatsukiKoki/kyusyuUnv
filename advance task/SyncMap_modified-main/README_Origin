First create a directory with the name "output_files" in the current directory.

Then run the following:
$python main.py problem_number output_filename

where, output_filename is the name of the output file and problem_number is the number of the problem.
Respectively, 
1: Mixed Structures
2: Fixed Chunks 
3: Sequence 2
4: Sequence 1
5: Long Chunks
6: Overlap 1
7: Overlap 2

For continual versions run the following:
$python dynamic_main.py problem_number output_filename

problem_number refers to the problems below:

1: Continual Mixed
2: Continual Fixed


The default learning algorithm is set for SyncMap.
