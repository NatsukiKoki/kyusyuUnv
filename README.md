# Repository of KyusyuUnv task
This repository is the selection process of Kyushu University.
I put the two types of tasks in two folders respectively. They named basic task folder, and advanced task folder.
The task I finished is bellow:

[B1] Reconstruct images from CIFAR, MNIST or both from noisy images. 

[B2] Train a neural network to calculate the similarity between images in CIFAR, MNIST or both.

[A2] Take a look at the paper "Continual General Chunking Problem and SyncMap". Download the code mentioned in the arxiv version. Your task is to improve more than 5% in both Overlap1 and Overlap2. Explain the results.(**Not finished, I thought this task is related to the A3 task,but my method cannot reach the requirement of this task**)

[A3]{X} Remove DBSCAN from SyncMap. Use edges and weights to determine clusters. Your results is to both decrease the variance from SyncMap and increase accuracy in most of the tasks.
